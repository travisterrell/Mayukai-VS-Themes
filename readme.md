# Mayukai Visual Studio Themes

These Visual Studio 2022 themes were directly ported from the Mayukai VS Code themes. https://github.com/GulajavaMinistudio/Mayukai-Theme.

## Status
These work, but I'm considering it a definite WIP for a couple reasons...
1) I notice that the official Microsoft VS Theme Converter does a pretty bad job at matching the original theme. For instance, in Alucard, the access modifiers should be pink, but here they are in a beige color. Pretty disappointing, tbh.
2) I've only converted the 2 that I like most so far, but will probably add the others soon.

If anybody goes through the effort of fixing them for themselves, please make a PR for me. Thanks!
